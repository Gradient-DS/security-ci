"""Parse and validate per-repo security exception files.

Policy (spec §7): exceptions are a last resort. An entry is legitimate only
when no fixed version exists AND the package cannot be replaced AND a second
reviewer has confirmed the vulnerable path is unreachable in our usage.

Scoping. A trivy entry may carry an optional `paths` list naming the files
that actually produce the finding. Without it the exception is tree-wide,
which means a NEW offending file added anywhere under the scanned roots
inherits the exception silently -- acceptable for a CVE in a pinned package,
dangerous for an IaC check like "container runs privileged". With it, the
suppression covers only the listed files and a new one still fails the build.
Paths are relative to the trivy SCAN ROOT (the directory handed to
`trivy config`, or the path inside the image), not to the repository root.

Grouping. A gitleaks entry may carry an `ids` list instead of a single `id`
when ONE value produced several fingerprints (the same placeholder in five
deleted docs, the same webhook on thirteen lines). The prose is written once
and every fingerprint in the list is suppressed by it; each still has to be
unique across the file. Only gitleaks supports this: a CVE id names a
finding on its own, so grouping would hide which advisory a reason covers.
