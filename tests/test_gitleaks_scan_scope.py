"""The gitleaks scan must depend on the ref under test, and on nothing else.

`gitleaks git` runs `git log -p -U0 <log-opts>` and defaults those options to
`--full-history --all`. Combined with `fetch-depth: 0` in the workflow — which
fetches every branch — that made a PR's gate depend on every other branch in
the repository: a secret on somebody else's unmerged branch failed an unrelated
PR, and no exception could durably suppress it, because a gitleaks fingerprint
contains a commit SHA and changes the moment that branch is squash-merged.

Two properties are tested here, and they pull in opposite directions:

  * scoped   — commits reachable only from another ref must NOT be scanned;
  * complete — everything reachable from HEAD must STILL be scanned, including
               root commits and content deleted long ago. The bug must not be
               "fixed" by degrading the scan to the PR diff.
